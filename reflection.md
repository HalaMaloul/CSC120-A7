- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
In the cafe class I decided to overload the sellcoffee method with hard-coded # nSugarPackets,#nCreams to indicate that the user wants a specific size and doesn't care how you make it.I also overloaded the constructor and hard-coded that the cafe doesn't have an elevator because we said they don't.

In the library class I overloaded the constructor with the has elevator hard coded as true because most libraries have elevators 
also I overloaded  the checkout method so it takes both the title and the persons name as arguments because we need to know who took the book 

In the House class I overloaded the moveout method so it  idicates that the room was emptied when someone movesout (hard coded true) because when someone movesout they empty their room.Also I overloaded the moveIn method so it takes both the name and iD and updates the Arraylist when someone moves in because I think we need the student iD
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I feel like going back to the slides was helpful and I think future students shoud do that too
